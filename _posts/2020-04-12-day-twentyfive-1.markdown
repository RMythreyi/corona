### Fitness Progress
This will probably be the final day of "step one" of the routine as I am planning to ramp it up from tomorrow.

### Research Progress
As feared, the results from yesterday were incorrect. I did some course correction, and also had a conversation with my advisor. It was a productive day.

### PhD Preparation
There are some new sources of concerns because of the current COVID situation. I have factored in the advisor and research project in my decision, and it has impacted the decision a lot. So, I might have to do some recalibration if there are changes. I would still be doing good, there's no doubt. However, it is causing some concerns. For now, it seems like switching to an online mode of instruction could be an option that will come to light with time.

### Bonding
All of us at home watched "Searching" together on PrimeVideo. It is a great movie, one I watched a few months back. I have started filling up some of the pending entries on the blog, they will go live soon.

### Tamil Progress
Changed the instructor today, but only completed one lesson. I will have to ramp up the pace soon.

### COVID-19 Update
There are close to 1000 new cases, and the total is nearing 8500 in India. There are talks that once this lockdown ends, there will still be continuation in some form with three types of zones being declared: Red, Orange and Green. This will help because we can't withstand extended petrification of economic activity.
