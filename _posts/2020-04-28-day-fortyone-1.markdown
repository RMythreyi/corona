excerpt: It was unplanned. But, unplanned fun is the best type of fun.

### Fitness Progress
Continued the morning routine with 75% intensity. Apart from this morning routine, I also walked for a while in the evening (literally went around in circles indoors).

### Courses Progress
I finalised the questions for the assessment that I am creating as the TA. Since the questions are applications based, they seem interesting to even the non-expert. At the end of the day, if people learn something new because of the quiz, I am happy.

### Bonding
We did something fun today at home: karaoke! It was unanticipated, and very impromptu. There's a lot to improve (obviously) but it was still fun (obviously). There was an attempt to make fancy bread which didn't go very well, so there were some spats, but they went away soon. We also finished watching the first Harry Potter movie. Fun day overall.

### COVID-19 Update
There's a huge spike in new cases in Tamil Nadu suddenly and there are talks of the onset of community spreading in the Chennai region.
