excerpt: Celebrated a friend's birthday by simply catching up over text!

### Bonding
Today being one of my best friends' birthday, I did some extra bonding, particularly with old friends. It is during such catch-up sessions do we realise how much we have stayed the same, and at the same time how much we have grown. We had a long conversation "over text". While it was a little juvenile, we still had a great time like the old days. It's funny how I have now become old enough to have "old times" that I can recollect very vividly.

The usual evening bonding activity was good as usual, and it also helped that we had good dinner to top that off.

### Research Progress
I did some background reading to identify if there are any ways to optimise my code, particularly the time it takes for input and output. I was glad that some of the "big submissions" were done, but I still have to wait for more results.

### Fitness Progress
The Yoga session continued in the morning, and there was nothing different from the routine.

### Tamil Progress
I completed the Std 2 textbooks today, and I am proud of the progress made so far.

### COVID-19 Update
New cases in Tamil Nadu has shot up to 104 today. The reprieve that could have come on April 20 didn't happen and the lockdown has been extended. The total number of cases in India is hovering at 16000, and over 3.8 lakh people have been tested. There was news that the kits bought from China are faulty. And, there was also a Nobel Prize winning French scientist who suggested that the virus was manmade.
