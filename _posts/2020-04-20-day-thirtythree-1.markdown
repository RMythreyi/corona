excerpt: Sometimes when there's a lot to process, the solution can be adding more things to the mix.

### Fitness Progress
I increased the load a little during the morning Yoga routine. It has now reached 67% of the expected full load.

### Bonding Progress
One of the projects I have been working is getting rattled because of some new developments. Personally, I am not sure how to respond to this test, and I am unsure if I had a role to play to have caused this. Then again, as with all team projects, it's never one person's effort or fault. So, the question remains if the project will continue to exist or if it will simply fizzle out. My mind went into overdrive thinking about the consequences, but I have made up my mind to face the outcomes, no matter how hard they are.

I caught up with some college friends over text, and also helped out a few of them because of my access to the institute servers through VPN. It was good to catch up.

### Tamil Progress
I completed a few of the lessons from Std 3 Term 1 book, it seems almost like I am getting into some kind of groove here.

### Course Progress
I was asked to prepare some questions for an assessment as a teaching assistant. So, I wracked my brains and tried to remember the examples that were used in class when I took the course as a student. There was supposed to be an end semester exam scheduled for tomorrow, but rumour has it that the exam will get postponed.

### Writing Progress
Although unrelated to the two writing projects I already have been talking about, I put in some work for the magazine team I am a part of. Not enough progress has been made, but I am working on it.

### COVID-19 Update
India saw its biggest spike in new cases per day so far (1520+ cases, 60+ deaths in 24 hours). The total is now a lot over 16000. Tamil Nadu has officially extended its lockdown till May 3rd. Is this some form of a losing battle? Is community spreading inevitable even with lockdowns?
