### Fitness Progress

Did Yoga in the morning, didn't do much exercise after that.

### Pondering (no more) about my PhD

Today was Day 2 of the Virtual Visit Days at Caltech for prospective students. Today's events mostly involved interactions with current graduate students and alumni. It was enlightening in some sense. And, overall things add up and paint a good picture about my decision.

### Bonding

I spent a good amount of time catching up today, and it was quite fun. Ended up sleeping a bit late because of this, but it was worth every minute. I also spent a lot of time discussing important world issues at home. It was nice to have thoughtful conversations, and it made me feel like I have definitely grown up.

### COVID-19 Update

There's been a surge of new cases all traced to one source: a congregation in Delhi that had at least 1300 participants from Tamil Nadu alone. Out of these 1300, 80 have been tested positive, and 515 have been traced and placed in quarantine. The rest of them will eventually be quarantined, but it's likely that there are already many local hotspots by now. The only good thing: most of the country is still in lockdown.
