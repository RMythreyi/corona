excerpt: Finally, after doing our waiting, almost 10 years of it, my sister and I are creating new Potterheads at home.

### Fitness Progress
Continued the routine at 67% capacity.

### Bonding
I started accepting answers in the RG Form (refer to [\[`017`\]]({{ site.baseurl }}/posts/17)). As a result, I connected with a few friends. I then discussed some of the responses (old and new) with people at home. It's a very distracting exercise: RG-ing. And, it's not even half done!

At home, we started watching the movie "Crimes of Grindelwald (2018)" and with this we are officially kickstarting a Harry Potter marathon at home, except that it isn't a continuous marathon, but we are planning to go over all movies in the original series after this. It's time to create more Potterheads at home!

### Cooking Progress
I made some noodles today, nothing very new. There was also some interesting almond essence filled chocolate cake at home. I didn't participate in the baking! However, I did do the dishes.

### COVID-19 Update
I think the total is close to 25000 in India today, and I am also starting to feel the lethargy of lockdowns slightly. Looks like things might stay this way for some more time!
