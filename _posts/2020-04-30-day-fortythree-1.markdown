### Fitness Progress
Continuing the Yoga routine in the morning with 75% intensity.

### Writing Progress
I finished a few more posts for this blog, but didn't reach the personal goal of finally catching up. However, I did do a few more writing related activity.

The main one is active participation in the private Beta of the Materials Modelling Stack Exchange site that is hopefully going to get kickstarted soon. I didn't expect I would finally get over my inhibitions and post a question, but I did. So, I am glad that I crossed that barrier. There's a lot left to do though. I followed a lot of rabbit holes and eventually ran into someone very inspiring. I hope one day that I can channelise all my energy and enthusiasm into something worthwhile.

### Research Progress
After a mini break, I finally resumed my work, and I took a look at potential topics to add to my thesis. I collected a small repository of other people's theses so that I can get some idea of how to structure mine.

### Bonding
We finished watching Chamber of Secrets and started watching "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)". To see the look of anticipation and interest on the new Potterheads is definitely a great feeling!

### Reading Progress
I have been reading Word by Word intermittently (although this blog doesn't reflect it, the tracking sheet does the tracking to some extent). I finally finished the book, and wrote a heartfelt, long [review at Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3310511059?book_show_action=false){:target="_blank"}. I felt good after the review. It's time to start the next book soon!

### COVID-19 Update
The spike just got spikier! There were 160+ new cases in Tamil Nadu. Oh no!
