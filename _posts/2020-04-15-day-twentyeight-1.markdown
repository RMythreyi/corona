excerpt: I spend extended hours today thinking about and discussing future opportunities that are a little off the beaten track.

### Fitness Progress
I did the usual routine but I faced a minor setback because of the Yoga mat. It was funny because it wasn't too painful.

### Bonding
I spent some time figuring out the rules of Codenames. It turns out the both the times I played before, I got the rules wrong. But my friends and I are working on getting a themed version set up using the web version of the game. Hopefully, we'll get that going and it will become more fun.

I spent a lot of time today talking about potential "alternate" career options. Most of them involved creating content to be consumed online. It was a stimulating conversation and I am glad that my parents feel the same as me when it comes to certain options. I am looking forward to seeing if we can make some progress on this front in the near future.

Our evening activity extended longer than usual, but it was good overall. We also watched the old Tamil classic "Mouna Ragam" and since it was a non-cliche story, the experience was good.

### Tamil Progress
Amidst all the consultancy talk, I also sneaked in a few Tamil lessons. I am happy to be making progress and "sounding smart"!

### Writing Progress
Although it doesn't count as writing directly, I added some new features to the current blog including a more informative (and hence high maintenance) summary page, and links to nearby posts from within one post. These additions will make navigation better.

### COVID-19 Update
If things go well, the lockdown will partially end on April 20, or this is what the guidelines seem to indicate. The number of new cases in Tamil Nadu is going down, so perhaps we have averted Stage 3? We will have to wait and see, but hopes are high. There are talks that if vaccines or treatments don't become accessible soon, then we will be facing an uncertain situation until 2022. But, I don't personally think that a vaccine or treatment will evade us for long. Let's wait and see.
