### Research Progress
Started working properly on the project and worked until late at night, but I still have a long way to go. I found a "research work spot" on the floor, which was a fresh change.

### Bonding
Spent sometime helping out a friend. After almost a month of a friendly challenge, I finished it and got to discuss about it over video, which was fun. We restarted the evening bonding activity at home, and it was good.

### Reading Progress
Read a little bit, but not enough to meet the daily objective.

Some people are under the impression that we are making fun of other countries while not being in a safe position ourselves. Truth is, I don't think anyone sensible is making fun of the situation right now. Every single person is in this together and everyone understands that it's going to take sometime to recover.
