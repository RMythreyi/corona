### Fitness Progress
As I increased the load a little, I am finding it marginally more intensive. So, perhaps it is progress.

### Bonding
I had a good conversation with one of my friends who is on an academic track like me. During our discussion, I realised that there are ways in which I can help, and hence I offered to help.

Later at night, I talked to my childhood friend. It has been a while since we connected, hence it was a good experience overall. We realised that memories of school were triggered by the same set of songs, and it also invoked memories of familiar scents to both of us. I think those are things that cannot easily be taken away from us. And, no matter what happens, at least for these reasons, we will remain important to each other. I mentioned this to another friend.

In the evening, apart from the usual activity, we also played one round of Codenames. It was a very entertaining exercise, and I was surprised on more than one occasion.

### Writing Progress
I didn't write anything new today (apart from some of the catch-up entries on this blog). However, I got a review for one of my first ever writing attempts. I had written a small "book" when I was fifteen: a story about a bunch of kids who are interested in cryptography. I had previously sent it to a few people but not many took it seriously and read it, let alone give me a review. But today, I got a detailed review, and I feel great!

### Pondering about my PhD
I declined some of the other offers I had received. I also sent a separate email to a professor to politely decline. I think it's very important to remain courteous and collaborative with people whose work you are inspired by.

### Tamil Progress
Restarted some of the lessons. There's still a long way to go, but I am happy that I have reached the stage where I craft sentence long answers and actually write them down. I am pretty excited as it reminds me of school.

### COVID-19 Update
As the twenty one day lockdown nears the end today, the lockdown is going to be extended by another nineteen days (until May 3). However, there is a possibility that some of the restrictions will be eased on April 20. Till then, everyone must continue life as such. I think we are doing quite well at home. However, some of the people I know are going "mad" with boredom.
