### Fitness Progress
Sticking to the usual routine in the morning. It's staying at 67% capacity for now.

### Pondering (no more) about PhD
I spent sometime reaching out to friends and acquaintances who I had reached out to for getting inputs while making my decision about graduate school. I also provided some inputs to another friend who is still making up his mind. It was good to talk, and also put to some use the huge amount of research that I did from my side for the process. One of my good friends who often has counter opinions told me today that seeing me has changed his perception of the process and the purpose. I would like to take that as a good thing.

### Bonding
I personally realised how much whether we enjoy something or not depends on our mental makeup. If there's some open loop that is constantly bugging us, we may not always get the same feeling of satisfaction even when that activity has previously always made us feel good. I identified that spending time aimlessly is the main trigger for me. So, I am planning to work around it. Good distractions and good food do help to recover though.

Since I was reaching out to friends actively, I got to speak to a couple of them over phone. It was good to catch up with people in foreign land because the current crisis is causing a lot of changes all over the world. Understanding the situation in other places also makes us feel more empathetic.

I noticed that once my friends were aware of their challenges, it becomes easier to help. But I used all my newly gained exposure to the best of my ability with even those who could not admit to the challenges yet. As I discovered today, staying confined makes everyone a little bit irritable at the very least.

### Cooking Progress
I didn't do the work myself, but I helped around a lot while cooking dinner. It was sumptuous food in the end, something I realised was achievable given the right mix of ingredients and process. But, maybe I will feel more confident after I recreate the dishes to my satisfaction.

### Organising Progress
There was a box of things lying around untouched from when I returned from my hostel. I finally cleared it up a little and tranferred the things to its respective places. However, I haven't yet sorted them properly. I am procrastinating that.

### COVID-19 Update
Everything seem bleak now. Tamil Nadu had 74 new cases today, and there was an announcement that there will be an even stricter lockdown enforced from Sunday in five districts (including Coimbatore).
