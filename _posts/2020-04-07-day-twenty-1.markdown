excerpt: After over five months, I made a positive contribution to work!

### Fitness Progress
I am continuing the daily Yoga session in the morning. I am not sure of its benefits, but it's better than doing nothing.

### Research Progress
I spent a lot of time summarising my work so that it can be presented, and at the end of the presentation, I got inputs as well as some cheer. I am looking forward to making more positive contributions.

### Bonding
We had cake today after a long time because of my sister and mother, I didn't help in the preparation though. It was pretty tasty and gave some morale boost. Later in the day, I made a decision to make the next move in one of my projects. But, after discussing potential outcomes, the project itself seems to be in jeopardy.

### COVID-19 Update

Two weeks of the nationwide lockdown has come to a close, and I think I have set into a pseudo steady state. There's still a long way to go because we haven't yet done enough testing to be sure that we are making progress towards flattening the curve.
