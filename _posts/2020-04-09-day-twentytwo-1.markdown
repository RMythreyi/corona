### Fitness Progress
The routine is finally becoming a routine and I am excited. I am planning to ramp up the routine bit by bit over the course of the next few weeks.

### Bonding
I spent a major part of today in conversations both deep and light. I got back in touch with an old acquaintance and we ended up discussing some profound things including the occasional mention of "solving the world's problems", and I am glad I have come out of it in one piece (mentally).

After a few hours, I got back in touch with one of my good friends as we spoke about everything from life to work to the final season of a popular TV show. It was a refreshing conversation, the first in a long time, and I came out of it very rejuvenated.

Later in the day, I spent a lot of time playing pictionary with friends I made in the lab at IIT Madras (across batches). I ended up winning both the rounds we played but it was a close fight and I had to constantly remain on my toes.

### Courses
I evaluated many assignments as a part of the teaching assistant job, and I made quite a few observations which I felt would make one of my professors  happy. So, I tried to cogently communicate them to the professor.

### COVID-19 Update

The number of new cases in a day is continuously increasing. People say we might see the effect of the lockdown soon now that over two weeks have passed. However, it's not clear if we will see the end of the lockdown anytime soon.
