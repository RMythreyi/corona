### Fitness Progress
Increased the intensity of the morning routine to 83%, I am really happy to have hit the eighties here.

### Writing Progress
I finally caught up with the blog posts! It's now back to where it should be. I also spent a long time on the Stack Exchange site. It was fun to write an answer for the first time.

### Bonding
We finished watching Prisoner of Azkaban. The time-travel part really seems to have sold this movie well. I also answered some doubts later. I feel like we are on our way towards becoming a Harry Potter erudite household!

I had some weird discussions over a phone call with a friend which left me thinking for a while, but after sometime I became somewhat more sure of my thoughts. I might have to take it up with my friend again to sort out the matter once and for all.

### Cooking Progress
After closely following the preparation of a tasty side-dish for chappati, I understood that sometimes experiments that go wrong in the kitchen can be salvaged if we are careful enough. Oftentimes, this salvation will come in a different form than what it started as.

### Reading Progress
I started reading "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams.

### Course Progress
I answered some doubts as a Teaching Assistant, and I also posted a message about the upcoming assessment that I have prepared. I started watching some lectures from the course I am doing, I really need to catch up with them soon.

### COVID-19 Update
The number of new cases has shot up to over 200 in just Tamil Nadu and the total in India is at 35000 cases! Dark days. The Central Government has officially extended the lockdown by another two weeks with some relaxations in some districts. We are all waiting with bated breath.
