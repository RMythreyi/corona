excerpt: After a couple of days of laziness, slowly moving back on track.
---

### Fitness
I did yoga in the morning; nothing different from the usual.

### PhD Preparation
I submitted requests for visa related documentation. I heard that some universities are giving the option of continuing studies online instead of just deferring. But, Northwestern hasn't informed me of any plans yet. I will have to wait and make a decision. However, talking to others who are in a similar position as me does help.

### Bonding
I spent sometime talking to family and it was good to have discussions. I also continued the movie with my sister. Later in the day, I had a call with friends and we had a decent conversation. Nothing much came out of it, but it was good to connect. I had some good food (modaks) at home, but I didn't help much with the preparations.

### Tamil Progress
After nearly a ten day break, I restarted my Tamil lessons. However, it didn't go for long.

### Research Progress
After a while, I finally brought up the courage to send a report to my advisor. I wasn't entirely sure if the report made sense, but I am glad I made an effort.

### COVID-19 Update
The Prime Minister talked to all the Chief Ministers in India to get their views on the lockdown. It looks like the lockdown will mostly get extended. The total count has gone to 7500+ today with over 1000 new cases just in 24 hours. The number of deaths has gone up too.
