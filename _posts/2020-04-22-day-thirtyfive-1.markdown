### Fitness Progress
I am sticking to the 67% load routine. I feel that the routine is helping already, but I am not sure if it's just an illusion.

### Research Progress
I spent a major portion of today creating relevant plots from the results. I had a great time doing this because I was learning new tools in the process and creating (sometimes unnecessarily complicated) workflows across tools to get this done. Since learning new tools is one of my favourite ways to pass time, I am really glad that I am getting a chance to do it as a part of my research itself. Unfortunately, later in the day, I found out the plots were incorrect, so I must redo most of the work tomorrow.

### Bonding Progress
I am starting to spent more time on the phone "chatting" casually with friends. While this is a fun exercise, it sometimes feels like empty fun because I often repeat what I am saying (because some of these chats end up simply being catch up conversations).

Not all conversations were shallow, however. I also spent sometime recalling good moments to answer one of my friend's informal RG-type questions (as discussed on [\[`017`\]]({{ site.baseurl }}/posts/17)). We also decided to send out ours really soon. So, it will be memories time very soon!

I spent a lot of time talking to my sister as well about important as well as silly things. It was good fun!

### COVID-19 Update
While some parts of the world is gearing up and hoping that everything will settle down by September 2020, the total number of cases in India crosses 20000 today. The scenario in Tamil Nadu is a little promising, with just 49 or so new cases.
