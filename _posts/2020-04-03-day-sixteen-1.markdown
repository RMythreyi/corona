### Pondering (no more) about my PhD

Today was the second day in the Virtual Open House. I had meetings with as many as five different professors, four of which included some discussions on research areas. One of the meetings was over lunch (more like late dinner for me). I also met some prospective cohort members, and some do seem nice and approachable. I once again spent some time "chilling" with other group mates and also ran into other grad students in the department in the "small chat rooms". The whole thing was organised really well, and I feel very confident that I have made the right choice.

### Bonding

I spent sometime catching up with a friend. It was good to talk, and I hope that I keep getting chances to do this.

### COVID-19 Update

I didn't follow the news much today because I was adjusting to another timezone (which meant I slept through most of the day). I think the numbers are just under 3000 in India.
