excerpt: Spoke to many, also got spoken to by many. Interesting day.

### Fitness Progress
I modified the routine a little bit to make it more intensive. I also saw the sun after a very long time thanks to a "walk" on the terrace.

### Bonding
I spoke to a junior from IIT Madras to give my views on the graduate school application process. It was interesting to see how my thoughts had evolved after going through the application process. Ironically, later in the day, I talked to another friend because I sought some reassurance myself. It's funny how quickly tables can turn. They made another switch later at night, when I offered intellectual advice in an area that I am not an expert in. But, it isn't as bad as it sounds. I did give sound advice and asked the right questions.

We had a team meeting for a magazine I am a part of. It was good to look back and think about the tasks left pending. During the evening bonding activity, I tried a memory check, and it went decently well. I am happy that I am getting good at the activity with practice. I also watched "Eye in the Sky" with my father. It was a gripping movie.

As I thought about how life has been over the past three weeks, I realised that there are quite a lot of things that I have left unattended. I need to be making some progress in these activities that I have ignored. It was comforting to know that I am not the only one at home who feels this way. We all collectively sat down, discussed and made some decisions to alter how we are going about these days. The conversation was refreshing, and it's moments like these that I will cherish.

### Research Progress
I have made some modifications and they seem promising, but I am not able to ascertain that the progress is correct at the moment. I will have to also figure out how I am going to make a cohesive thesis for the project. As I start thinking about it, I am panicking a little, but nothing too out of hand right now.

### Cooking Progress
Although I didn't do any of the required work, I stood by and watched the preparation of one of the famous South Indian sweets. I must admit that the process on the whole doesn't seem very challenging; I will just need some time and patience. But, getting together all the necessary equipment to aid the preparation will take some time and may be hard.

### COVID-19 Update
The lockdown is going to go on till the end of April in Tamil Nadu, and the Prime Minister is planning to address the nation tomorrow. I must admit that while most of the people I interact with have been under lockdown, there are still news stories everyday about how the lockdown rules and social distancing norms are not being followed by some people. It is saddening, but also not entirely those people's fault. It's hard to take a stance on such happenings.
