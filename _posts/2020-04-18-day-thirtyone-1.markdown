excerpt: Feelings of "boredom" creeps in now and then, but then we do something to change.

### Bonding
We had the regular activity in the evening, and today was better than most days. We are slowly getting into the groove and making good progress. Apart from the usual language learning, my mother and I also had a discussion on English (using NCERT books). It was good fun, but it's hard to gauge the feasibility of this new plan.

Personally, I finally feel like I am stuck in a rut sometimes. There's a lot to do, but I am unable to do everything from home. In this regard, we had another round of discussions at home, with a possible change in the way things work from tomorrow. I also am motivated to start something on my own because that's been in the back of my mind for a long time but I haven't done it yet.

### Tamil Progress
I started Term 3 of Standard 2 and completed a few lessons. It's starting to become easier to swallow new things, but I don't yet know how and when I will "feel" proficient.

### Research Progress
I sat down and modified the code to make it run again. Funnily, I later discovered that I didn't have to modify anything other than pass a compile time flag. Very interesting to see how Fortran can be both frustrating and beautiful at the same time.

### Reading Progress
I resumed the book "Word by Word" after a while. It is a very entertaining read. I hope to finish it soon.

### Fitness Progress
I am continuing the Yoga session in the morning.

### COVID-19 Update
The average number of new cases is hovering around 40-45 for the past few days in Tamil Nadu, could this be the flattened curve? We aren't sure yet, but with another two weeks of lockdown left, perhaps we can capitalise on this start.
