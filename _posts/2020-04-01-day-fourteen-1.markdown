### Research Progress

It has taken two weeks for me to dust off the project and get it going. But, I am happy I have finally started. I need to buckle up and do it more seriously in the days to come.

### Learning Tamil

I completed the entire syllabus of Standard 1, which may not sound like much, but it's the most formal education that I have received in Tamil so far. I am making progress towards understanding the script and reading a little faster. I have taken it upon myself to speed up my reading skills by the time this lockdown ends.

### Cooking Progress

I helped in the preparation of some home-made snacks today. It didn't come out as well as I had hoped, but at least we have some snacks now to munch! I also helped in the preparation of dinner, which was basically a rather healthy attempt at noodles.

### COVID-19 Update

The number of new cases crossed 1800 in India, with 110 new cases in Tamil Nadu today. All of these cases can be traced to the congregation in Delhi that seems to have spread a lot of COVID-19 cases in India. The new cases in my own city has shot up to 30 or so today. However, we are all very impressed by how the TN Government is handling the situation. They deserve a lot of respect for selflessly toiling at this time of dire need. I am also hearing slowly that many people I know no longer have jobs, because some companies are rescinding offers they already made. This is an awful situation, but I really hope we all can pull this off.
