excerpt: The entire day was quite heavy on thinking activities. Glad to say most were good things in the end.

### Bonding Progress
One of the projects I am working on faced a huge upheaval and the aftermath has been very bitter and a little sweet. The good thing is that while it seemed like the project might have to be cancelled for a short while in the middle (which led to unpleasant consequences), eventually the confidence returned and the project is still on. Not sure if the deliverables will be met, but that uncertainty doesn't mean that it's not worth pursuing the goals.

Later, I had a somewhat long discussion with my friend about some important things and after the discussion, I had some more clarity on those things. After this conversation, I had one more at home with my sister which also gave some clarity of thought. We had good pudding at home (home made), but I didn't participate in the preparation stage.

### Courses Progress
The exam that was scheduled for today did get cancelled. I spent some time framing some more questions as TA, and I eventually got good feedback for the questions.

### Fitness Progress
I am continuing the routine in the morning, and while it seems like it is not very rigorous, I still feel that it is better than nothing and sticking to it over a long period of time will produce some positive results.

### Research Progress
Since the big simulations were done, I started the plotting. But, because of the issue in the output file, there seems to be a lot of problems with visualisation. I did my best to fix the problems.

### COVID-19 Update
There are close to 19000 cases in India now. Sometime in the day, I realised I  needed to change the batteries in my wireless mouse. While searching, I found a packet of batteries that I had purchased just over a month back, and thought about how simple it had been to purchase them then. To think of how much life has changed in a month and a half is a little scary. The worst part? I am getting used to this life as the new normal. I am not sure if that's a bad thing or a good thing. It's probably both.
