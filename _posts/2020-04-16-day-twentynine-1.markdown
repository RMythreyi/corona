### Bonding
I tried to work from home in a lab atmosphere today, but it wasn't a big success. However, I had work to do, so I did it. And, as I worked, I also explained some of my work to my mother, and it was an interesting experience. I am glad that others at home are interested in learning more!

### Tamil Progress
I completed the lessons in the first term of the Standard 2 textbook and started the second term. I am progressing in my reading ability, but my spelling and speed is still sub-par. I must keep working and improving.

### Research Progress
A major part of the later half of the day went in actual work towards my project. I first did the ground work to make sure that I was in a position to start big calculations which require a lot of time. After doing a thorough and categorical check, I submitted the big jobs. Hopefully, they run without much trouble and I get to make more progress.

### COVID-19 Update
There was an announcement from IIT Madras highlighting plans about a "staggered" semester start, and also the conducting of final exams and project reviews for final year students first (in mid May). But, the whole plan seems unlikely and there are more logical plans that involve more of remote learning. So, after a lot of discussions, a few people decided to get their opinion heard. Some are skeptical about the situation in India as we haven't hit our "peak" like the USA and other countries. However, looking at how cases in TN are steadily falling for the past 3 days, I think all hope isn't lost yet. Maybe we did act enough early enough? Let's wait and see.
