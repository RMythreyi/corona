### Fitness Progress
Continued the Yoga practice in the morning. I am starting to slowly accept that if this was ever going to be useful, it would require me to make it a little bit harder every week.

### Courses
I spent sometime helping with an online quiz as a teaching assistant, it was an interesting experience.

### Preparing for the PhD
Although it's unclear at the moment as to whether I will get to start my PhD in the coming Fall, I am going ahead with whatever I can do at the moment regarding documentation. I did some preparation in this regard.

### Bonding
Spent sometime identifying a common movie to watch with my sister, we decided on watching "Guardians of the Galaxy". It was fun. Later in the night, I spent a lot of time with friends playing "Codenames". It was the first time I played the game, it ended up being quite fun!

### COVID-19 Update
There are some rumours now that the 21-day national lockdown will mostly get extended. The number of cases is going up daily, and everyone is a little anxious.
