excerpt: After many unsuccessful games, my team finally won today! TWICE!

### Fitness Progress
I am sustaining the routine in the morning at 67%.

### Bonding
Connected with some of my old classmates, ones I haven't really spoken to in over a year or more. It seems like most have moved on with life, and we shall forever be acquaintances who acknowledge each other until life puts us on paths that cross one more.

I also spoke to one of my good friends who I admittedly used to talk to more until a couple of months back. It was good to connect, and we sort of remind each other of our goals and interests.

Later at night, I had a fun conversation with a group of friends and we played Marvel themed Codenames (in which my team won twice in a row!). It was super fun, particularly the guessing and the random links that I formed in my head for clues.

The Pottermania has officially been stirred up at home, and we finished "Crimes of Grindelwald (2018)" today. The evening session was good like most days.

### Writing Progress
This isn't directly related to any of the blogs I have in mind, but I did some writing which counts as memoir chapters. I shared these writings with the friends who were in the story with me, and I was happy to find out that I am able to communicate my thoughts and feelings well in my writing.

### COVID-19 Update
A strict version of the lockdown starts in Coimbatore today, but nothing is new. I tried to stay away from my phone for sometime to keep a sane mind.
