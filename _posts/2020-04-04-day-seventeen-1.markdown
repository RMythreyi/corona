### Bonding

I spent a majority of my waking hours (close to five hours) helping out my friend who is in the process of securing a PhD position. I felt that I was able to positively contribute, and that makes me happy. I also spent sometime helping another friend who is in the lookout for PhD positions by doing some surveying on my own of his potential options.

We didn't do any of the usual bonding exercises at home. I hope it gets started again.

### Research

I have actively started working on the project. Although I admit that it's no way in great shape now, I must shape it up in the next week or so. Let's see what happens.

### COVID-19 Update

The number of cases in India has crossed 3000. I didn't follow the news personally, but I just found out that there are allegations flying around and a mini "war" over medical supplies has broken out in the world. That's alarming. I hope it doesn't get too much out of hand.
