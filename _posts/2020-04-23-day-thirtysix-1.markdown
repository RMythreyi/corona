### Fitness Progress
Although I don't think consciously about it, I just do what I do usually. I am finally starting to understand what a "routine" means.

### Pondering (no more) about PhD
Now that I am pondering no more, and that Northwestern University seems to have confirmed that I am a part of their incoming batch (although we are not sure when that will happen as of now), I felt it was time I updated the people that helped me out with the applications. So, I started with those friends who played the stronger roles.

### Research Progress
I got the new plots ready, it was fun to use tools and do it in a neat manner. I am particularly impressed by the default colour scheme in Matplotlib. However, the precision issue I ran into yesterday remains to cause more trouble. I need to be more careful next time onwards. I posted an open call for help regarding a new file format (HDF5), and I am glad to say that there are many who are willing to step in and help me out initially. So, I might make a call to do the implementing soon.

### Bonding
I spent a lot of time thinking about how the mental health of many people, including some of my friends, is being affected by the COVID crisis. So, to be able to do my part, I spent some time learning about how to be supportive. I found out that some people are capable of identifying potential setbacks early, while some are still in denial. I have sworn to do my part to make sure that I am doing everything I can. I hope that I can learn enough to do this.

Later, I spent time talking to one of my good friends. Both of us had similar takes on how we felt about growing up. It was heartening to have an open conversation although the situation didn't necessarily seem conducive to such discussions.

### COVID-19 Update
Tamil Nadu only reported 33 new cases today. The question is whether the situation seems to be settling down or is it too soon to say?
