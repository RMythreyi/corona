Hello, internet.

I am Mythreyi Ramesh, and I am pursuing my undergraduate studies at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM). IITM is located in Chennai, India. However, because of COVID-19, every student has been asked to leave the campus and return home indefinitely. So, my current location is Coimbatore, India.

I am in my final year, and a major portion of my academic duties for this year entails working on a research project. Since my project is purely computational in nature, I can work remotely. However, not all of my friends are this lucky. Then again, academic progress isn't the need of the hour.

As soon as it was evident that I will be spending a long time in a lockdown-like
situation, I decided that for once, I will actually commit to spending my time in a systematic manner, making sure that I do pursue all my interests in the time that remains after my research work. Some people say that as a researcher, I am not supposed to be pursuing too many other interests, but it's hard for me to do just one thing.

On top of research, I want to read books, write, learn to play the violin, learn to cook, do some form of physical activity, spend quality time with family and more. Doing all of this is a tall ask. But, I am hoping that committing to maintaining a public log (although no one I know knows of this at the moment) will help me stick to my goals.

Let's see where this leads. Indeed, only time will tell.
